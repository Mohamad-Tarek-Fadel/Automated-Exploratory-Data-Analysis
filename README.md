# Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tool

## Overview
The **Automated EDA Tool** is a Python-based project designed to streamline and simplify the exploratory data analysis process. It automates data preprocessing, statistical summarization, and visualization, making it easier for users to uncover insights from their datasets. The tool is especially useful for data analysts, researchers, and students looking to save time and minimize errors in their data analysis workflow.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load datasets directly from CSV files.
- **Statistical Summarization**:
  - Summary statistics for numerical features.
  - Value counts for categorical features.
  - Overview of missing data.
- **Automated Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical features.
  - Scaling numerical features.
- **Visualization Dashboard**:
  - Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots for numerical features.
  - Count plots for categorical features.
  - Correlation heatmaps for relationships between numerical features.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-eda-tool.git
   cd automated-eda-tool
   ```

2. Place your dataset (CSV file) in the project directory or provide its absolute path.

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python DataAnalysis.py
   ```

4. The program will:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Provide a summary of the data.
   - Automatically preprocess the data.
   - Generate visualizations for exploration.
